OOP345NFF Workshop 4 Reflect
============================

This project was both a valuable and challenging experience for me. Working through modules such as Utility, 
Station, CustomerOrder, Workstation, and LineManager challenged my understanding of object-oriented programming. 
File management and dynamic memory management Each step presents unique challenges, from implementing efficient 
error handling and exception handling to creating appropriate classes. Relationships and Inheritance Structure 
We are clean. The biggest challenge is understanding how the components How are they related? while maintaining 
the organization and codebase. This trip helped improve my debugging skills. and gain familiarity with C++ features 
such as exception handling for STL containers, seeing production line simulations come to life. And know that 
it was created from scratch. It is an incredible award. In the end This project has strengthened my confidence 
in solving complex problems. and improve your ability to think critically and logically in programming.
