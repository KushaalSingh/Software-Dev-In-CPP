OOP345-NFF Project Reflect
==========================

This project was a comprehensive and challenging experience for me. Working through the 
different modules – Utilities, Station, CustomerOrder, Workstation, and LineManager – 
pushed my understanding of object-oriented programming, file parsing, and the intricacies 
of managing dynamic memory. Each step presented new obstacles, from handling exceptions 
and ensuring robust error checking to correctly implementing class relationships and 
inheritance. The biggest hurdle was grasping how the different components interacted with 
each other and maintaining a clear, organized codebase. This project helped me improve my 
debugging skills and deepen my understanding of C++ features like STL containers, exception 
handling. It was gratifying to see the assembly line simulation come together, knowing I 
built it from the ground up. Overall, this project has boosted my confidence in tackling 
complex problems and enhanced my ability to think critically and logically about programming 
challenges.
